SUMMARY

# SUMMARY
The top client (client ID- 24741) showed a profit of $36.58 M which was much higher as compared to other top 4 clients.
 With further analysis of measures of central tendency, I see that the mean and the median are skewed. 
The median for Total Profit- $1894.84 as compared to the top client's total profit ($36.58 M)
The mean for total profit- $ 29,392 vs. the top client's total profit is very different.
The top client's total profit accounted for over half the total profit for all the clients put together.
The clients at the top of our data frame have a lot more profit than the others, which caused the median and the mean to be lower than if the total profits were distributed more evenly.
